- 👋 Hi, I’m Anthony/Miptz
- 👀 I’m interested in getting familiar with Linux, Arch to be more specific. I'm willing to experiment with other OS's though! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing, but feel free to give me ideas.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I'm too inexperienced 
- 📫 How to reach me; you can always throw me a DM on Discord! (LavaStyle#3767)
