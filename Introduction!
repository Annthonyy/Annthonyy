- 👋 Waddup, I’m Anthony/Miptz.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting familiar with Linux, Arch to be more specific. I'm willing to experiment with other OS's though! Besides that, I'm sort of a mechincal keyboard nut. Come at me with an questions you may have about it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing, but feel free to give me ideas.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I'm too inexperienced. I'm willing to have someone beat information into my head though.
- 📫 How to reach me; you can always throw me a DM on Discord! (LavaStyle#3767)
